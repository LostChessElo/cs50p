# CS50P 

Note: This README will be used as a journal to document my journey through CS50P.
P.S. If you notice any repeated letters after words (like the letter "r" over and over), my keyboard is broken — forgive me.

## CS50P Problem Set 0

I found this set of problems to not be as challenging as I'd like, except for the "Tip" problem, which I got stuck on for a little bit because I'm not as confident with try blocks.
Overall, I'm feeling confident about the next set of problems.

## CS50P Problem Set 1

Problem Set 1 presented new challenges that made me much more confident with try blocks.
I found the Math Interpreter challenge difficult, but I overcame it in the end — it took me by far the longest to complete.
Overall, I feel more confident in my ability to overcome new challenges.

## CS50P Problem Set 2 

Not much difference between this problem set and the prior ones, although I can feel a slight increase in difficulty.
Notable takeaway: Programming is becoming increasingly fun. I love difficult challenges — they force me to come up with creative solutions.
Overall, excited for the next problem set!

## CS50P Problem Set 3 

This problem set was by far the most challenging so far and took me almost 2 days to complete.
Main challenges were EOFErrors, but I got more comfortable with them.
I can see improvement in my ability as I completed the last issue with little to no trouble.

### Overall takeaway:
I need to read up more on exceptions and how to utilize them correctly, as I ran into an issue where an exit code 1 was sent instead of exit code 0. This is usually caused by unhandled exceptions, which I fixed in two ways:

Using the sys module with sys.exit()

Rewriting the code in a different format by excluding the EOFError exception from the while loop

## CS50P Problem Set 4 

This problem set taught me a lot about the importance of documentation, not only in Python but in programming in general — especially when diving into new libraries and concepts.

### Problems I struggled with:

#### professor.py
My original solution didn't use a for loop, so I failed the unit test a lot and had to come up with a new solution.
This meant I basically had to delete all of my main function's logic and start fresh.

#### figlet.py and bitcoin.py
The only issues I had with these two problems were related to parsing command-line arguments.
It was challenging at first, but after going through the sys documentation and learning about argparse, I got the hang of it — more or less.

Overall: Nothing too challenging, excluding professor.py.

### Things I need to work on:

Separating my programs into bite-sized functions to improve readability

Making it easier to test and debug
Once Problem Set 5 is completed, I will focus on updating my previous sets to practice breaking down code into smaller, reusable functions.

## CS50P Problem set 5 

in this prroblem set i was immediately faced with a problem i previously discussed; not breaking down my code into smallerr fumcitioms
this increases readability and makes it easierr to test 

### Problems I struggled with:

#### Vanity Plates:
this unit test took me by far the longest, it was a trial and error i had to wrtie ALOT of test cases and hope it would run 
but in the end i overcame it 

im getting alot better at wrriting rreadabel code and splitting uop my though process though 

## CS50P problem set 6

This problem set was the most fun so far in terms of difficulty. I vastly improved my code layout and functionality. As I come to the end of this journey, I've seen my code evolve and improve more than I ever thought it could — but I haven’t mastered Python in its entirety just yet!

### Problems I Struggled With:

#### CS50P Shirt:
The main issue I had with this, surprisingly, was the argument function. In the end, I used `os.path.splitext()`.  
Other than some minor syntax issues, the **PIL** library wasn’t all that bad — it just took a lot of reading.

I’m excited to continue this journey and finish CS50P!
