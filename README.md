#CS50P

#This README will be used as a journel to document my journey throrugh cs50p 


--cs50p p_set-0--

i found this set of problems to not be as challenging as id like except fot the tips problem which i got stuck on for a little bit because im not as confident in try blocks
overall i =m feeling confident about the next set of problems.

--cs50p problem set 1--

problem set 1 presented new found challenges  that made much more confident with try blocks
found math interpreter challanging but overcame it in the end , took me by far the longest to complete 
overall i feel more confident in my ability to overcome newfound challenges 

--cs50p problem set 2--

not much difference between this problem set and the prior ones although i can feel a slight increase in difficulty 
notable takeaway: programming is becoming increasingly fun , i love difficult challenges, they force me to come up with creative solutions 
overall excited for the next problem set!

--cs50p proble set 3--

this problem set was b far the most challanging so far and took me almost 2 days to complete 
main challanges were eoferrors but i got more comfortable with them
can see imprrovement in my ability as i complted the last issue with little to no trouble 
overrall takeaway: need to read up more on exceeptions and how to utilize them correctly as i ran into an issue where 
an exit code 1 was sent instead of an exit code 0 this is usually cause by unhandled exceotions which i fixed in 2 ways 
1: sys module utiliizing sys.exit()
2: rewriting the code in a different format by excluding the eoferrror exception from the while loop
